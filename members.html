								<h3>DJ Nishikino</h3>
								<p id="nishikinoText" style="display:none">Part of Kawaiicore Collective! since late 2014, DJ Nishikino is a truly talented producer with his ability to drive the crowds with high-energy songs.

								<h3>Camellia</h3>
								<p id="CamelliaText" style="display:none">Since becoming part of Kawaiicore Collective! in early 2016, Camellia never ceases to amaze everyone with his diverse styles of J-Core productions, creating some highly acclaimed J-Core songs, such as INSECTICIDE and crystallized.

								<h3>Yoshikazu Nagai</h3>
								<p id="NagaiText" style="display:none">Being the latest addition of Kawaiicore Collective!, Yoshikazu Nagai is nothing short of a miracle, as he brings happiness to many people from his uplifting J-Core songs, but also manages to make people dance hard from his heavier works. Before joining Kawaiicore Collective!, Yoshikazu Nagai is a composer for <i>Touhou Project</i> music under the name SAISEN TURN. He is the lead producer of KAWAIICORE!Vol.3 album, and he also re-releases most of his older works on Kawaiicore Collective!</p>
